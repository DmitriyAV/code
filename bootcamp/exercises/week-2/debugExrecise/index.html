                    Maul was a Force-sensitive Dathomirian Zabrak male who established himself as a crime lord during the reign of the Galactic Empire. He was once known as Darth Maul when he was the apprentice of Darth Sidious, and therefore, a Dark Lord of the Sith. Having trained in the ways of the Force, Darth Maul was a formidable warrior strong with the dark side and possessed deadly skills in lightsaber combat. In addition, he was a scheming mastermind who plotted his return to power despite losing his place in the ranks of the Sith.

Born in 54 BBY during the era of the Galactic Republic, Maul was the son of Mother Talzin, leader of the Nightsisters of Dathomir. Maul also had two siblings, the Nightbrothers Savage Opress and Feral. Sensing his potential, Sidious took Maul as an apprentice while he was still a child in 40 BBY. Anointed by his Sith Master as Darth Maul, the Dathomirian was raised to hate the Jedi Knights that served the light side of the Force. Desiring to see the Jedi Order fall, Darth Maul trained for the day when the Sith would exact revenge on their ancient foes. The time for revealing the Sith's continued existence to the Jedi came during the Invasion of Naboo, when Darth Maul confronted Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi. Though he killed Jinn, Maul was, in turn, defeated by Kenobi, who bisected the Sith assassin at the waist. Darth Maul was believed to be dead in the aftermath of the battle but ultimately survived, emerging a decade after his defeat, during the height of the Clone Wars.

Despite learning that his Master took a new apprentice, Darth Tyranus, Maul still believed that he was a Sith Lord. Taking his brother as an apprentice, Maul and Opress held that they were the true Sith rather than Sidious and Tyranus. He then devised a scheme to seize power on the planet Mandalore, overthrowing the New Mandalorians and installing the Death Watch as the new ruling government. In addition to the Mandalorians, Maul expanded his criminal enterprise, the Shadow Collective, to include the Pyke Syndicate, Black Sun, and the Hutt Clan. However, as his power increased, Maul became a threat to his former Master's plan, resulting in a confrontation that concluded with Opress's demise and Maul's capture by Sidious. After escaping with the help of his Mandalorian super commandos, Maul resumed his reign on Mandalore until he was overthrown by the Grand Army of the Republic.

Maul survived the end of the Clone Wars, witnessing the Great Jedi Purge of Order 66 and Sidious's rise as Galactic Emperor. Chastened by his former Master on the principle of the Rule of Two, Maul abandoned his claim to the mantle of the Sith, focusing instead on building an empire of his own—the Crimson Dawn—by controlling the criminal underworld. Ultimately though, Maul remained driven by the desire for revenge, specifically against Sidious, the Master who disowned him, and Kenobi, the Jedi who defeated him. During his conflict with the Jedi fugitives Kanan Jarrus and Ezra Bridger, Maul tracked Kenobi to Tatooine, determined to finally end their rivalry for good. Their last lightsaber duel ended when the Jedi Master struck down his old nemesis. Believing that Kenobi had consigned himself to a life of exile to protect the Chosen One, Maul died taking comfort in the belief that he would be avenged once the Sith's prophesied destruction was realized.
                In 54 BBY,[2] the boy who would be dubbed Darth Maul was born the son of Mother Talzin on Dathomir.[16] As a Dathomirian Zabrak male, he was a Nightbrother[17] and had two blood brothers, Feral[18] and the oldest[19] of the three, Savage Opress.[18] Later in his life, Maul claimed that he once had a real name but that he had long since forgotten it.[15] Before his first birthday, Talzin gave the Zabrak infants their first tattoos.[20] As a child, since his days living in deep caves, Maul wrestled with a deep inner anger.[21]

According to legend, Maul grew up with one of his brothers in a house in the Nightbrother Village, often needing to take care of his younger, weaker brother due to Talzin always being away with the Nightsisters. Growing up, he always felt a connection to nature and the forest outside their house, a by-product of his Force-sensitivity.[22] While he was still a child, Mother Talzin became an ally of Darth Sidious, the Dark Lord of the Sith, the two beings exchanging knowledge of Dark Side arcana and Nightsister magicks.[16] Legend had it that, when Sidious visited Talzin, Maul always hid in his room, afraid of the man and worried about Talzin's increasing bond with him.[22]

Taken by Darth Sidious
"Sidious promised to make me his right hand, but instead, he stole what was most dear to me... my own flesh and blood. My son!"
―Mother Talzin recounts how Maul became Darth Sidious's apprentice[16]
Maul's struggle with anger eventually caught the attention of Sidious.[21] Around 40 BBY,[23] Sidious would take Maul away from Dathomir to become his Sith apprentice. According to Talzin, Sidious betrayed her and stole Maul away.[16] According to a legend that went into more detail, Sidious ordered Talzin to give up Maul to a keeper, threatening to not follow through on his promise to make her his apprentice. She reluctantly agreed, and Maul ran into the forest angrily, overhearing the conversation from behind his door. When he returned the next morning, a Nightbrother took him and threw him in a pit, not allowing him to say goodbye to his own mother.[22]

AnUnwillingApprentice-MaF

Over the course of months, Maul was put through relentless domestic abuse, all orchestrated by Sidious as a test. He lived with his Nightbrother keeper's two sons, who beat him to the point of being unable to stand up every few days and kept starved by only being given the scraps his "brothers" didn't eat. This eventually started to warp Maul's perceptions, and his love for his mother eventually turned into resentment and hatred for abandoning him. Just as Sidious wished, his hatred started manifesting through the Dark Side, and he would practice using the Dark Side of the Force every chance he got; eventually, the two brothers stopped beating him after seeing that their provocations were no longer affecting him. Eventually, rumors swirled of a man soon arriving for the Selection to acquire a warrior apprentice, and all the Nightbrother boys prepared for it.[22]

When the day arrived, Maul's keeper refused to allow him to participate, but he used the Dark Side to break his locked door down and follow anyway. At the Selection Arena, Maul found out that the visitor was Sidious. In a sudden burst of anger, he used the Dark Side of the Force to Force-choke the two brothers, and then the keeper, all in front of Sidious and Talzin. Beyond pleased at Maul's progress and potential, Sidious declared Maul the winner and his new apprentice, to Talzin's dismay.[22] Sidious took Maul and left Dathomir, Talzin swearing to get her stolen son back and have her revenge on Sidious.[16]

Serving the Sith
Apprentice of the Dark Lord
"I was apprentice to the most powerful being in the galaxy once. I was destined to become… so much more."
―Maul[9]
Under Sidious's tutelage, Maul trained as a Sith apprentice,[2] Sith warrior,[24] and Sith assassin,[25] eventually being given the title "Darth Maul." For years, Darth Maul was trained to become a weapon of the Sith. He became an acrobatic warrior, one trained to be relentless against his enemies, and learned to use a dual-bladed lightsaber, eventually crafting his own,[5] using plans given to him by his master. The plans had been hidden by Sidious in a forgotten entrance in the ancient Sith archives.[26] For his lightsaber, Maul used pieces that he had stolen or otherwise acquired. As he noted to himself while sitting in darkness in the time before the Chommell sector summit, a large amount of pain and blood that had gone into the construction of his weapon. However, the majority of the blood that had been spilt in the creation of the weapon was not his.[21] During lightsaber training, Maul trained with Marksman-H training remotes.[27] He also learned martial arts through droid training.[28]

During his training, Sidious took Maul to Malachor to bear witness to a great battle that occurred there between the Jedi and the Sith.[29] Maul mastered his anger, letting it burn in him, and under his master's supervision, began to turn his anger into hate.[21] Sidious forced Maul to breathe in the ashes of Sith warriors, slain when an ancient weapon was activated in the Sith temple on the planet. While breathing in this ash, Maul had visions of members of the Sith order being struck down by the Jedi. He felt the slash of saber after saber as he felt the death of his Sith brethren.[29] His Sith training made Maul long for revenge against the Jedi Order,[1] which had defeated the Sith a millennium earlier.[30] With his master, Darth Maul hoped to destroy the Jedi and restore the Sith to galactic power.[1]

However, Maul's hatred of the Jedi was more personal. He was filled with anger when he realized that as a child, the Jedi had not come for him. Maul did not know if they found him unworthy or simply ignored him, and their neglect fueled his rage, counting the days until he could have his revenge. He was impatient with his master's planning, resenting the pain and suffering he felt as he waited for his time to unleash himself on the galaxy that had hurt him so much.[21]

First encounter with a Jedi
"Jedi. The peacekeepers of the Galactic Republic. Cowards. Wallowing... nesting... hiding in the peace they enforce. Their strength is waning. Deep down, they know they cannot maintain order forever. And when their time begins to tumble into darkness.. they will find me waiting for them."
―Maul as he stalks Khaat Qiyn and her apprentice[31]
Darth Maul vs rathtars
Darth Maul hunting rathtars on Twon Ketee

Several years into his training as Sidious's apprentice, Darth Maul began to become impatient. He longed for a confrontation against the Jedi. Maul enjoyed hunting wild game and stalking the Jedi Khaat Qiyn and her Padawan, Bairdon Jace, in the shadows on Coruscant. During one excursion, Maul traveled to the swamp planet Twon Ketee to hunt rathtars as he waited for orders from Darth Sidious.[31] Beforehand, he hired a group of big game hunters to scare the rathtar out of hiding as he watched from behind a tree. He quieted his mind and used the Force, sensing the nearby presence of the beasts. A rathtar attacked the hunters, and Maul leaped onto the beast killing it with a spear. However, Maul had sensed the presence of another rathtar attacking him from behind, realizing that they were pack hunters. Maul had wanted to use his lightsaber, however knowing that the hunters would notice his Sith nature, he chose not to. Maul cut of the creature's limbs on-by-one and eventually used branch in order to kill the second rathtar. Having finished his training he headed back to Coruscant.[27] It was while hunting rathtars that Maul reflected on their viciousness, ruthlessness, and freedom. The rathtars he hunted had no master, unlike himself. Sidious warned Maul to avoid the Jedi until his plans were ready to unfold. While he praised Maul for this thirst for vengeance, Sidious did not want Maul revealing himself until the time was right. Sidious threatened Maul with death if he continued to risk detection.[31]

In an attempt to satiate Maul's bloodlust, Sidious sent him to the Kellux system to dispatch pirates who were interfering with the Trade Federation. Maul traveled to Kellux and dispatched the pirates who had kidnapped members of the Trade Federation. A pirate, mistaking Maul for a Jedi, begged for his life in exchange for information. The pirate informed Maul that Xev Xrexus of the Xrexus Cartel had captured a Jedi Padawan who was going to be auctioned off to the highest bidder. Maul dispatched the remaining pirates as well as the kidnapped members of the Trade Federation and began his search for the Padawan.[31]

Maul hired a group of bounty hunters (Cad Bane, Aurra Sing, Vorhdeilo, and Troo-tril-tek) and traveled to Nar Shaddaa in an attempt to learn the location of Xrexus's auction. Maul got into a bar brawl after being accused of being a Jedi. He was blinded during the fight by the Quarren gangster Dirty Calgriz—whom Maul quickly killed thereafter—and was nearly surrounded when the fight was intercepted by Bane, Sing, and Vorhdeilo. Bane informed Maul that the bounty hunters had gotten hold of an invitation to Xrexus's auction. The bounty hunters had killed the Haddrex Gang and stolen their ship and protocol droid, FE-B3. Troo-Tril-Tek and Maul tortured FE-B3 until they extracted the location of the auction.[29]

Auction of Eldra Kaitis

Maul and the bounty hunters then traveled in the Haddrex Gang's ship to a space station in the Drazkel system to attend the auction. Xrexus told those gathered that the Padawan, a Twi'lek named Eldra Kaitis, had been found on a crashed Republic transport vessel which had been attacked by pirates. While Xrexus greeted her guests, Maul searched the space station and found Kaitis in a holding cell.[29] While searching for Kaitis, Maul was caught sneaking around the station by Xrexus, and Maul provided a fake name, Seris Madreth of the Haddrex Consortium, to trick Xrexus. Maul then spoke with Bane and the other bounty hunters to come up with a clean way out and a backup plan.[32]

Maul returned to the auction, where he allowed the Moogan Jee Kra to take Kaitis. Maul and his bounty hunters then confronted Jee Kra and his crew at their ship. There, Maul and his bounty hunters killed Kra and his crew. Maul told Bane to get the ship into space and confirmed to Kaitis that he was a Sith. However, Xrexus had planted an explosive on the shuttle, and it was forced to crash-land on Drazkel's moon.[32]

On the moon's surface, Maul, Kaitis, and his bounty hunters survived the crash. Maul and his bounty hunters saw that Xrexus was sending ships after them and split up; Maul and Kaitis would lead the hunters away while Bane, Sing, and Vorhdeilo would take a ship from them. When they were surrounded by the hunters, Maul gave Kaitis her lightsaber, and the two of them fought the hunters together. After defeating the hunters, Maul and Kaitis prepared to fight each other.[33]

Both proved to be a match for each other. At first, Kaitis used her lightsaber to cause a landslide that buried Maul. As she was going in for the kill, Maul rose and stabbed her through the chest. He then destroyed FE-B3, after which he was picked up by Bane and the other bounty hunters using a stolen Flarestar-class shuttle. Maul compensated them, and they dropped him off at Xev's hideout. There, Maul killed Xrexus to ensure the Sith's secrecy. He then returned to Lord Sidious on Coruscant. His master knew he had killed the young Padawan, but he pleased his master by telling him that his lust for Jedi was not satisfied.[34]

Working with Zek Peiro and return to Malachor
"Breathe deep, my apprentice. Let us see what the dark side has to show you."
―Darth Sidious, to Darth Maul[35]
Maul, in disguise, formed a fake cartel under Kaitis's name and later worked with the Force-sensitive Zek Peiro in intercepting shipments of scarn, a compound used to manufacture spice. Maul and Peiro fought several of their buyers and found the scarn. He killed Peiro with a piece of metal and left him. Maul returned to Sidious, who spoke of his concern about Maul's antics and how he was as foolish as Peiro.[35]

Malachor-AoR-DM
Maul and Sidious return to Malachor.

After killing Peiro, Maul and Sidious returned to Malachor to expand his Sith training. During his time on Malachor, Maul breathed the ashes of the long-dead Sith and had a Force vision. In his vision, Maul was a Jedi and saved a fellow Zabrak from a creature. Maul was invited to dinner with other Zabraks to thank him. Maul, disgusted by the Zabraks' idolization of the Jedi, became a Sith and beheaded the entire group. After his vision ended, Maul was praised by his master, and Maul realized that it would take more than his rage and emotions to destroy the Jedi.[35]

Revealing the Sith to the Jedi
"At last, we will reveal ourselves to the Jedi. At last, we will have revenge."
―Darth Maul, to Darth Sidious — (audio) Listen (file info)[7]
After years of looking for revenge against the Jedi, Maul became part of his master's plan to take over the Galactic Republic and destroy the Jedi. Sidious, who was secretly Senator Palpatine of Naboo, conspired with the Trade Federation to invade his planet as retaliation for the taxation of trade routes in outlying Republic star systems. The Federation launched their vessels and blockaded Naboo, and prepared their battle droid army. Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum, whom Palpatine aimed to replace through the invasion, dispatched Jedi Knights Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi to resolve the situation, but the Federation attempted to kill the two Jedi, forcing Jinn and Kenobi to the surface. Once there, and as the invasion began, they rescued Queen Padmé Amidala and escaped from Naboo.[7]

Maul dispatches his Sith probe droids to locate Queen Amidala.

Because Amidala was necessary for their plans—the queen needed to sign a treaty that would legitimize the illegal occupation of Naboo—Sidious dispatched Maul to find the queen and the Jedi. Maul traced a distress call from Sio Bibble, the governor of Naboo, which Queen Amidala received on Tatooine. With his master's permission, Maul traveled to Tatooine to locate the queen.[7] He landed in the desert with his personal starship, establishing it as a mobile base for his operation.[36] From his starship he launched a trio of Sith probe droids to seek out the queen and her Jedi protectors, and thanks to one of them, he discovered her ship just as it was preparing to leave. Maul rode across the Tatooine sand dunes on his Bloodfin, his personal vehicle of choice, towards the queen's ship. However, he encountered Qui-Gon Jinn, one of the Jedi Knights who was trying to protect the queen, and a young boy named Anakin Skywalker.[7]

Nevertheless, the Sith Lord attacked Qui-Gon Jinn, and the two engaged in lightsaber combat. The Jedi commanded that Anakin board the ship and tell the pilot to take off. It was a short but intense duel, Maul using his terrifying agility and ferocity to tire Jinn out with his vicious lightsaber technique. Just as Jinn had succumbed to Maul's power and fury, and Maul was looking to finish the Jedi off, the queen's ship came to the rescue and Jinn jumped aboard, leaving the Sith Lord fuming with rage on the sand.[7]

Although Jinn and the queen escaped, the Sith had revealed themselves to the Jedi for the first time in a millennium, and the Jedi Order wondered how the Sith could have returned after so many centuries. Despite his targets' escape, Maul embraced what he had achieved and let himself become more consumed with darkness and hatred. What Maul did not know was that Skywalker, the young boy who was destined to be the Chosen One, would one day all but destroy the Jedi and become a Sith Lord himself.[7]

Duel on Naboo
"Lord Maul, be mindful. Let them make the first move."
"Yes, my Master."
―Darth Sidious and his apprentice before the Battle of Naboo[7]
Maul Neimoidians
Darth Maul worked with Nute Gunray and other Federation officials during his time on Naboo.

After the Jedi and the queen escaped, they made their way to Coruscant, where Sidious, as Palpatine, manipulated Amidala into calling for a Vote of No Confidence on Chancellor Valorum, prompting a new election where Palpatine was a favorite to win and take over the Republic. Maul, meanwhile, returned to Naboo by order of his master, where Amidala and the Jedi also returned to in order to fight the Federation occupation force. Eager with anticipation of the confrontation with the Jedi, Maul planned to choose the location of his inevitable duel with the Jedi.[21] The Naboo, along with the Gungans who lived in Naboo's oceans, led the Federation army into battle away from the capital city. Using the battle as a diversion, the queen and the Jedi fought to regain control of the city.[7]

Upon arrival on Naboo, Maul was greeted by the Neimoidians, but he ignored their attempts to comfort him, instead opting to quickly complete his task of choosing the battleground. He decided to lure the Jedi into the series of corridors and catwalks leading to and within the power generation facilities not far from the hangar, and he practiced swinging his lightsaber and moving around to get used to his surroundings. He jumped over the chute in the middle of the final room, where he planned to kill the Jedi. He decided the hole did not matter before getting a communication from Gunray. Ignoring his urge to hunt upon learning the Queen's starship had landed, Maul advised they let the Naboo and Jedi come to them.[21]

Maul fights Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi during the Battle of Naboo.

The battle for the capital reached the royal palace, where Maul was waiting for Jinn and Kenobi. The Sith Lord fought the Jedi in the palace hangar, before moving into a generator complex. The duel raged on throughout the generator rooms, with Maul dominating the duel; he did, however, give ground in order to lead the Jedi throughout the complex. Maul separated the Jedi by knocking Kenobi down several levels, and Kenobi was unable to catch up to Maul and Jinn due to laser walls standing in his way. Taking advantage of their separation, Maul fought Jinn alone and eventually stabbed the Jedi Master through the torso, mortally wounding him.[7]

DrawCloser-SoH
Maul stunned Jinn by slamming his face with the hilt of his lightsaber.

When Kenobi finally caught up, the two engaged in a ferocious fight, with Kenobi filled with anger and grief over the death of his master and friend. Although Kenobi chopped Maul's double-bladed lightsaber in half, leaving the Sith Lord with only one blade, Maul disarmed Kenobi and Force-pushed him over the edge of a vast reactor shaft. Caught off guard, Kenobi dropped his lightsaber and found himself dangling over the abyss from a small input nozzle. Maul kicked Kenobi's lightsaber into the shaft below him. As Maul taunted the young Jedi, trying to dislodge him from the wall, Kenobi calmed himself and used the Force to jump back up and summon Jinn's lightsaber into his hand. In an instant, Kenobi sliced the blade through Maul's waist, cutting him in half and sending him falling down the shaft, an act that would drive him to insanity and hatred towards Kenobi.[7]

That same day, Sheev Palpatine became Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic. Both he and the Jedi believed that Maul had perished on Naboo.[7] As such, Sidious made Count Dooku, a former Jedi Master[37] whom he had already converted to the dark side,[38] into his new apprentice.[37]

Exile in the Outer Rim
"...he lives in the Outer Rim, in exile."
―Mother Talzin tells Opress that Maul survived[17]
LothoMinorJunk-TCW
The battered Maul lived on in the junk fields of Lotho Minor.

However, through his hate and rage, Maul managed to survive being cut in half as his top half fell down the reactor shaft and into a trash container.[20] A combination of his Nightsister magicks, Dathomirian physiology and Sith tenacity served to keep him tethered to life even as his sanity began to leave him.[28] Maul's shattered body was dumped on the junkyard world of Lotho Minor,[39] where he lived in the bowels of the planet. There he utilized discarded metal to fashion for himself a six-limbed apparatus that allowed him to walk again.[40]

During Maul's exile, the droid Captain Spikewheel forced several people, including Gritz, Riki, Brennar, and Seles to spend a night on Lotho Minor in order to join her crew. When they first got on the planet, a confrontation broke out between Gritz and Brennar, and the ground gave way into a labyrinth.[41]

While exploring, Seles got separated from the group, and Brennar went looking for him. Brennar then found out that Maul had captured Seles. Maul, while muttering to himself, threw Seles at Brennar, and proceeded to chase them through the labyrinth. They eventually ran into a dead end. Maul was about to kill them when Gritz captured Maul with an electronet.[41]

They then traveled back to the surface, Maul in tow, to find Spikewheel waiting for him. Gritz and Spikewheel then revealed that they had been hired to find and capture Maul, and that it was simply a test for Gritz to become first mate. Gritz and Spikewheel, while listening to the message from the person that hired them, realized that the message was from Maul himself. Maul then escaped from his electronet and confirmed that it was him who sent the message because he needed a ship to escape. Spikewheel then attempted to shoot Maul, but the fallen Sith destroyed her. Seles panicked and attempted to grab the controls to the ship, which shot the ship straight into the sky. Riki opened the door to the ship and Maul and Gritz fell back to the surface of Lotho Minor. They left the planet and Maul killed Gritz.[41]

During his exile, he made a bargain with a sentient sneaky Anacondan called Morley, who agreed to bring Maul food in return for his leftovers. Over the years, Maul was driven mad with rage and despair but remained driven by thoughts of revenge against Kenobi.[8]

During those years, Anakin Skywalker, while training in lightsaber combat at the Jedi Temple, altered a training droid, giving it Darth Maul's appearance.[42]

The Clone Wars
Rescued by his brother
"The chains are the easy part...It's what goes on in here that's hard..."
―Maul, to his brother Savage[8]
HelloBrother
Maul, in a ruined state, is found by his long-lost brother Savage Opress on Lotho Minor.

Mother Talzin knew that Maul had survived. During the Clone Wars, she told his brother, Savage Opress, that the former Sith Lord could be found in the Outer Rim. Talzin gave Opress a talisman that would help him find Maul, and Opress set out to locate his brother. Opress found Lotho Minor and discovered his crazed brother living there, but Maul did not know who Opress was, and barely had a hold on his own identity. All that remained of the one-time Sith Lord was his lust for revenge against the Jedi.[8] Believing that Morley had severed his brother and driven him crazy, Opress killed the Anacondan and, to restore Maul's memories, took him to Dathomir, where Mother Talzin repaired Maul's mind and gave him a pair of cybernetic legs through an incantation, using parts of the Separatist droids destroyed during the Battle of Dathomir.[9]

Resurfacing in the galaxy
"To continue, we need one singular vision…my vision."
"Brother, let us share our strength. There is no need for dominance between us."
"Always two there are, my brother—a Master, and an apprentice. And you are the apprentice."
―Maul and Savage Opress[12]
MaulVsKenobi-Revenge
Maul and Kenobi fight for the first time in over a decade.

With his mind restored, Maul set out to seek revenge against Kenobi for defeating him on Naboo, and led the now-Jedi High Council member to Raydonia by slaughtering civilians to draw Kenobi out. Maul and Opress captured Kenobi, but the Jedi was rescued by Asajj Ventress, a former acolyte of Darth Tyranus and the Dathomir Witch who once commanded Opress. Kenobi and Maul engaged in a lightsaber duel for the first time in over a decade, and Maul goaded Kenobi into anger by talking about how he killed Qui-Gon Jinn. Kenobi was overwhelmed as a result, and decided it would be best for he and Ventress to escape the ship. Although Kenobi had escaped, Maul knew that the Jedi would begin pursuing him, which would play into Maul's hand in his quest for revenge.[9]

Following these events, Maul encountered a child whom he spoke about his return to galactic affairs with, promising the child that he would soon have his revenge and expose the Jedi to be a false order.[40] The brothers began a rampage across the galaxy, which took them to the Cybloc Transfer Station in the Cybloc system. After defeating the station's guards, the brothers discovered a credit coffer filled to the brim. Maul demonstrated his martial superiority to his brother by disarming him, earning the latter's respect. From that point, Maul referred to himself as Opress's Master, in the same manner as the traditional Sith Rule of Two dynamic.[12]

DuelOnFlorrum-Revival
Maul duels Kenobi while Opress fights Adi Gallia on Florrum.

After stealing the valuables on the space station, the brothers traveled to Florrum, where they bribed a squad of pirates into joining them. Although some joined, others questioned Maul and Opress's motives and were killed as a result, as Hondo Ohnaka, the pirate leader, was forced to watch. Eventually, the brothers faced off against Kenobi and Adi Gallia, a fellow member of the Jedi High Council, who tracked them there. After a duel that left Gallia dead, Kenobi lured the brothers into the pirate base, where they continued their duel in an isolated passage. When Opress had his arm cut off, Maul used the Force to push Kenobi down the tunnel, causing a cave-in before ordering a retreat. He also discovered that Ohnaka's forces reconciled with the renegade pirates, and likewise, Maul's hired group had turned on him. The brothers promptly escaped, although the effort cost Maul one of his artificial legs. They later barely escaped the doomed ship after one of Ohnaka's pirates shot out its engines with a rocket launcher. Because of this, Hondo believed that Maul and Opress were incinerated in the crash, though Kenobi suspected otherwise.[12]

Building the Shadow Collective
"Doubt will only lead to failure. Our combined strength will be rewarded. Mandalore will be yours. And Kenobi, this Sith pretender Dooku, and all our enemies…will fall."
―Maul, to Pre Vizsla, while Force choking Bo-Katan Kryze[10]
Maul and Opress managed to escape Florrum, although they eventually passed out from lack of oxygen in their escape pod. As they floated aimlessly in deep space, they were discovered unconscious and half-alive by Death Watch, a Mandalorian splinter group led by former Governor Pre Vizsla. Discovering Maul's lightsaber, Vizsla decided not to kill them as his lieutenant, Bo-Katan Kryze, wished to do; Vizsla believed that if they were enemies of the Jedi, then they were his friends. Vizsla and his men returned to their base on Zanbar, with Maul and Opress in tow.[10]

On Zanbar, medical droids healed Maul from his wounds and replaced the legs he had received from Mother Talzin for a pair of new mechanical legs that returned him to his previous height. Waking after the surgery was completed, Maul was groggy and only tried to react when he saw the still-unconscious Opress next to him, as the droids fitted the wounded brother with a mechanical arm. Vizsla and Bo-Katan entered and began to interrogate Maul, threatening to kill Opress if Maul refused to answer. Maul revealed that they were Sith Lords, which immediately led Vizsla to question him as to his links to Count Dooku. Maul angrily stated that he and Opress served no one and that they were brothers, the true Lords of the Sith. Satisfied, Vizsla asked him his intentions, and Maul revealed his plans to seek power and influence to gain his revenge over the Jedi. He also informed the Mandalorians that the Jedi responsible for their troubles was Obi-Wan Kenobi. Having faced Kenobi before, and knowing that the Jedi Master was a close friend of Vizsla's enemy, the Mandalorian Duchess Satine Kryze, Vizsla ordered the droids to complete the repairs to the brothers.[10]

Maul was later taken to Vizsla's shelter and revealed himself as a member of Death Watch, who purported to be the descendants of Mandalore's true warrior faith which had been rejected by the pacifists who ruled Mandalore. Vizsla also informed Maul of his and his warriors' exile from Mandalore after failing to overthrow the Mandalorian government and mused against the one responsible for their exile: Kenobi. Realizing that they possessed a common goal and a common enemy, Maul proposed an alliance between the brothers and Death Watch, claiming that it was the will of the Force. Bo-Katan rebuffed him, stating that the last time they had allied with a Sith, they had been betrayed. She also denigrated the Sith as being no better than the Jedi. Maul used the Force to choke her, and as the Mandalorians aimed their weapons at him, he claimed that thanks to their alliance, Mandalore would be theirs and they would dispose of all their enemies, as well as gaining their revenge against Kenobi and Dooku. He then released Bo-Katan, and Vizsla sent him to see to Opress while they put the alliance to a vote among the Mandalorians.[10]

Opress emerged from his coma and proceeded to destroy the medical droids with his new mechanical arm while Maul watched. As Opress grew agitated, Maul appeared to calm him and informed him of who they had fallen upon. He insisted that the Mandalorians would be more useful to their plans than the pirates ever would have been because the Mandalorians had honor. While Opress rejected this as a weakness, Maul stated that his plans would be better served by them and, once they had reclaimed Mandalore, they would use its resources to further their own plans, with the Death Watch under their command. Vizsla then arrived and announced that the alliance had been accepted by the Death Watch.[10]

Maul convinced Pre Vizsla they needed to recruit Black Sun so they could build an army, and with that, the alliance proceeded to go to Mustafar to recruit the Black Sun into their army. They were met by Ziton Moj, who brought the group to their council. Maul asked the council to join them, but they refused despite Maul giving them a second chance, and on Maul's orders, Savage activated his lightsaber and threw it across the table, decapitating the council and prompting Moj to form an alliance with Maul's forces. Upon returning to their camp on Zanbar, the Pykes also declared their allegiance to the Sith brothers.[10]

Next, the alliance traveled to Nal Hutta to convince the Grand Hutt Council to join their group. The Hutts refused to join as they had no credits to buy their allegiance, so Maul and his forces battled the Hutts' enforcers and hired bounty hunters. After defeating the bounty hunters and the guards, they met Oruba the Hutt, who was captured by Bo-Katan and her forces. After the Hutt could only tell that they would find the other Hutts at Jabba's Palace on Tatooine, they killed Oruba and headed to Jabba's Palace and besieged it. Overwhelmed by the Death Watch, Jabba agreed to join the Shadow Collective.[10]

While searching to create his crime family,[43] Maul and Opress sat in a cantina, planning to gain the favor of the leader of the Morubas crime family, Jjan. However, a patron at the bar overheard them and snitched on Maul to Jjan, who planned to poison Maul during his arrival. When arriving at the base, Savage led forces in an attempt to capture the Stronghold of the Morubas crime family. Maul entered Jjan's throne room, allowing himself to get captured in order to allow his forces to seige the stronghold, taking the crime family's power.[44]

Conquest of Mandalore
"I will use my army of crime lords to attack different targets across Sundari and sow chaos to undermine the Duchess's rule. Our gangsters will make her look too weak to maintain control. Then you and your Death Watch will capture and arrest us, bringing order where Satine's weak government could not."
―Maul to Pre Vizsla[45]
Now with an army under his command, Maul and the Shadow Collective planned to overthrow the government of Duchess Satine on Mandalore. Their goal was to make the Duchess look weak by sending the Collective's criminal elements to attack the capital city, Sundari, at which time Death Watch would arrive and drive them off. Maul also anticipated and counted on Pre Vizsla and Bo-Katan betraying him, an act that he counted on as part of his own plans.[45]

After Death Watch drove the criminals away, Maul's suspicions were confirmed when he and Opress were arrested. With Maul imprisoned, Death Watch declared themselves the leaders of Mandalore. Maul suspected that there would be other political prisoners nearby, other than the deposed and imprisoned Satine, who Maul could use for his own ends. The two Sith brothers broke out of their cells and sought to find a new ally, choosing former Prime Minister Almec as a puppet; Almec had been imprisoned by the Duchess on corruption charges.[45]

Having fought his way out of prison, Maul stormed into the Mandalorian throne room,[45] the Grand Salon,[46] and challenged Pre Vizsla to an honorable death match, knowing that the winner would gain the allegiance of Death Watch and become their new leader. After a long and spectacular duel, Maul overpowered Pre Vizsla and beheaded him with his own weapon, the Darksaber that ancient Mandalorians had stolen from the Jedi, which Maul then claimed as his own. However, Maul's victory split the Death Watch in two, with Bo-Katan and her forces refusing to pledge loyalty to Maul. The other half submitted to Maul's rule, while Almec was reinstated as Prime Minister—albeit with Maul as the true power on Mandalore.[45]

Ruler of Mandalore
Revenge against Kenobi
"Silence! You think you know me? It was I who languished for years thinking of nothing but you! Nothing but this moment! And now, the perfect tool for my vengeance is in front of us. I never planned on killing you, but I will make you share my pain, Kenobi."
―Maul prepares to murder Duchess Satine Kryze in front of Kenobi[47]
Shortly after the coup, Maul learned that the Duchess had tried to escape from prison and transmitted a distress call to the Jedi. Having learned of Kenobi's old friendship and relationship with Kryze, Maul realized she could serve as bait for his archenemy and the perfect tool for his revenge against the Jedi Master. As Mandalore was technically neutral in the Clone Wars, Maul knew that Kenobi could not receive an official sanction from the Jedi Council for a rescue mission. As such, he predicted that Kenobi would mount his rescue alone.[47]

After Kenobi infiltrated the palace and liberated his friend, Maul and the Mandalorian forces chased the two of them all the way to Kenobi's ship, Twilight. The Mandalorians fired missiles at the ship and crippled it, forcing Kenobi and Kryze to abandon ship before it was destroyed. Although dazed from the crash, Kenobi recognized Maul and Opress and attacked them, but Maul disarmed him and ordered his forces to bring Kenobi and the Duchess to the palace.[47]

The Duchess dies in Kenobi's arms, as Maul claims his revenge against the Jedi Master.

In the throne room, Maul taunted Kenobi to give in to the dark side, all the while holding Kryze in a Force grip. Kenobi angrily refused, and told Maul he had been to the Sith Lord's village on Dathomir; Kenobi further brought up Maul's horrific past by saying that it had not been Maul's decision to join the dark side, but rather the Nightsisters forced it upon him. The comments struck a nerve, angering Maul and causing him to lash out. He reminded Kenobi that it was the Jedi Master who truly made Maul suffer for over ten years, and that it was time for Kenobi to share in his agony. At that moment, Maul activated the Darksaber and stabbed it through the Duchess's chest. Kryze died in Kenobi's arms, before Maul ordered that Kenobi be taken to the prison to contemplate his loss. Kenobi later escaped with the help of Bo-Katan, who revealed herself to be the Duchess's sister.[47]</p>
